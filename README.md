entries with many subdomains.  Usually tied to many business clients.

Longer description:
Some ad companies use a DNS scheme that clutters up host file blocklists.

example:

shoestore.adcompany.com

foodplace.adcompany.com

cardealer.adcompany.com

... and hundreds more

Some browser-based ad blockers can support a fancier wildcard rule to block all subdomains of a top-level domain (example: *.adcompany.com) but a host file can only treat each name as its own line item.  Consequently, this list takes these domains and breaks them out.  The list is compiled from lookups taken from the Cisco Umbrella Top 1 Million list.  Cisco has some public DNS resolvers which billions of devices use

They publish a Top 1 Million list every day here:

This list is just a quick skim of that daily file and pulls out some domains which are known ad/tracking/analytics companies and throws them into a host file.  You could argue "this is a lot of junk for just 20 company domains.  Sheesh."  BUT these 20 or so ad companies host 20,000+ other companies that use their  ad/tracking/analytic products and this is how you would have to block them with a host file.  Sucks doesn't it.

It is just an experiment so I won't likely update it often.  If someone wants to do so I would gladly hand it off.
